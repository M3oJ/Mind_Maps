👨‍💻 Hello, Hacker! 👨‍💻

I’m Matin, an experienced Information Security Analyst with a passion for offensive security. As a bug hunter, I explore vulnerabilities, hunt for security issues, and contribute to the cybersecurity community. You’ll often find me participating in CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges on platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe.
